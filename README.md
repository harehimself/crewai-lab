   A testing ground for multi-agent coordination using CrewAI. Demonstrates agent roles, delegation, and planning using real task flows. Integrates tools, memory, and LLMs for collaborative execution. Includes working scenarios for knowledge synthesis and task automation. Clear separation of agents and orchestration logic. Great for exploring crew-based AI architectures.

   CrewAI is a robust and scalable multi-agent framework designed to facilitate the development and deployment of intelligent agents in a collaborative environment. It provides a modular architecture that allows for seamless integration of various agent types, ranging from rule-based systems to advanced machine learning models. CrewAI enables agents to communicate, share knowledge, and coordinate their actions to achieve complex goals more efficiently.
